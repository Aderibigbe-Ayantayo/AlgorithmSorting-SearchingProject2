Sure, let's implement the Insertion Sort algorithm in JavaScript. Hereâ€™s a step-by-step explanation followed by the code implementation:

Insertion Sort Algorithm Steps
Initialize: Start from the second element (index 1) and assume the first element (index 0) is already sorted.
Pick Element: Pick the next element (arr[i]) and find its correct position in the sorted part of the array (from 0 to i-1).
Shift Elements: Shift all the elements in the sorted part of the array that are greater than the picked element to one position to the right.
Insert Element: Insert the picked element into its correct position.
Repeat: Repeat steps 2-4 until the entire array is sorted.
